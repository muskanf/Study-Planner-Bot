# PlannerPro 

MADE BY: MUSKAN FATIMA & ELIZABETH BANGIYEV

PlannerPro is an AI-powered study planning assistant built with Streamlit and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT API. It helps students design and update study plans based on deadlines, exam dates, study preferences, and break habits. The assistant generates plans through a conversational interface, making it easy for users to interact and change their schedules. The app also includes a dynamic to-do list and calendar for task management.
