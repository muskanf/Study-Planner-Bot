Welcome to our project planner chatbot!
Heads up! Be sure to tell the bot how many hours you want to study per day and how long your study breaks should be.
Our poor PlannerPro has a bit of short-term memory loss, so it needs all the info in each message to build your plan right!


Prompt 1:
I have an exam on May 15 and a group project due on May 16.  
I want to study for 5 hours every day, only in the morning.  
Please include a 30-minute break after every 1 hour of studying.  
Build me a full plan starting from May 10 until everything is done.

Expected Response Summary:
PlannerPro will respond with a detailed schedule broken down by date from May 10 to May 16, with alternating study sessions for the exam and group project in the morning.  
Each hour-long session will be followed by a 30-minute break, and May 15 and May 16 will be reserved for final review and project submission.  

**Current Plan**
- Exam on May 15  
- Group project due May 16  
- Study 5 hours daily in the morning  
- 30-minute breaks every hour  
- Plan runs from May 10 to May 16

I have a midterm on May 20 and a paper due on May 21.  
I can only study in the evenings, and I want to do 3 hours each day.  
Please include a 20-minute break after every hour.

Expected Response Summary:
PlannerPro will create an evening-based plan from May 15 to May 21, allocating 3 one-hour blocks per day with 20-minute breaks in between, alternating between midterm and paper preparation.

**Current Plan**

- Paper due May 21

Prompt 3:
Can you help me prepare for my quiz on May 10?  
I can study 2 hours a day anytime, but I need a 15-minute break in the middle.

Expected Response Summary:
PlannerPro will create 2 consecutive 1-hour blocks with a 15-minute break between, beginning several days before May 10.

**Current Plan**
- Quiz on May 10  
- Study 2 hours per day (time flexible)  
- 15-minute break in between  
- Starts plan a few days in advance

Prompt 4 (Edge case - missing break info):
I have an exam on May 25 and want to study 4 hours a day in the afternoon.

Expected Response Summary:
PlannerPro will likely generate 4 consecutive afternoon hours of study but will not include breaks because they weren't specified.  
To test: check if the assistant prompts for missing break info or just skips it.

**Current Plan**
- Exam on May 25  
- 4 hours of afternoon study per day  
- No breaks included (unless explicitly asked)
